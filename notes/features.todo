TODO:

  ☐ Verify that if we installed an archive at version x.x.x and request an install of x.x.x+1 we override
  ☐ Support `archive` to package as a (zip, tar, ...)
  ☐ Support `upload` to send (http?, git, ftp, ...)
  ☐ Support `publish` which does an `archive` followed by `upload`
  ☐ Support `--save` in `install` to update the component library
