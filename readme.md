> The composite package management tool

### What does Klepto do?

Klepto is a package manager for self-hosted archive sets. Klepto provides the standard set of package management tools, but is designed to work alongside, or replace, existing package tools like [Bower](https://bower.io/) or [Component](https://github.com/componentjs/guide).

The main audience for Klepto is a development group that wants to setup their own internal package repository. Klepto also supports transitioning away from other component systems; with custom scopes Klepto will use a different transport protocol for each scope matched, so a single `vault.json` can pull from local folders, bower,  and http paths each with dependencies which pull from different transport protocols.

Klepto supports archives distributed through the web, github repositories, ftp, or local folders. It supports archives being pulled from multiple sources and also searching across multiple sources.

> _Archive_ is used to refer to any package Klepto can install or publish and should be taken as a synonym for module, package, or component.

### How does Klepto work?

When Klepto installs archives it:

1. Resolves the reference against configurable scoping rules (eg @internal/sub-folder/repo)
2. Pulls and caches an archive file/folder from an external source
3. Reviews the archive manifest (eg. _bower.json_, component.json, or _vault.json_) rules to install all dependent archives
4. All archives are placed in project archive folders, defined by the scope or match rule

> Klepto does not pass through any commands to existing package managers. It is a stand-alone package manager which allows a development team to distribute packages as they choose.

## Installation

> Klepto requires Node v6

Install globally via [npm](npmjs.org).

```bash
npm install --global klepto;
```

Install globally via [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

```bash
yarn global add klepto;
```

## Usage

After Klepto is installed globally invoke `klepto` to see the commands available.

```bash
klepto
```

Klepto is only useful in a project folder where we want to include additional remote code libraries (ie. archives). When you invoke Klepto it will look for repository configuration files or accept rules on the command line. 

The following will outline the usage and purpose of each command.

### Help

```bash
# write help information for the `klepto configure` command
klepto help configure
```
The help command will provide a terse summary of a command with a documentation on every switch the command takes.

### Version

```bash
# shows the current version
klepto version;
klepto -v;
```

Tracking and exposing the version of an application is standard practice. 

### Configure

```bash
# change the folder to store cached archives
klepto configure paths.cache ./cache
```

The configure command allows you to configure and inspect the settings which influence how Klepto will deliver/publish archives. The configuration which influences Klepto is calculated:

1. The internal default configuration from Klepto
2. The global configuration (at ~/.valultrc)
3. Every parent folder of the project folder, which is readable
4. The project folder itself

Each version over-writes keys the previous wrote. When you type `kelpto configure` you will see the entire configuration which affects Klepto.

#### Write/Read

The configuration command accepts a `reference` and a `value`. 

- If a value is provided, then the command will write a value to your local .vaultrc file (see `â€”global`). 
- If a value is not provided, then the command will read and show the key in the reference

```bash
klepto configure paths
# see all paths for storing folders
klepto configure paths.release .release
# change the release folder to ./.release
```

You can change all of these settings by editting the configuration in a text editor. See or create a .vaultrc file in your project, that file will override all settings.

#### Sharing Configurations

A useful application of this feature is to share configurations, for instance (see Install) if you want to give access to a set of install scopes (different paths to install/publisu) to an entire team, then you could share a single configuration at a root level of a users folder or project folder. 

If your folder structure were:

```
- Home
	- Development
	- .vaultrc
		- Project1
		- Project2
```

The .vaultrc file might have a scope defined. If Klepto is invoked in Project 1 or Project 2 it will know the scope and install from that remote repository.

The .vaultrc might have this in it.

```json
{
  "sources": {
    "internal-archive": {
      "pattern": "source/component",
      "pull": {
        "uri": "http://internal.co/components/${component}/${component}--${version}.zip"
      }
    },
  }
}
```

This configuration would allow us to install to or publish to `internal-archive` as a scope.

```bash
# will hit the server http://internal.co/
klepto install internal-archive/my-library@1.2.3
```

### Initialize



### Status

### Clean

### Download

### Install

### Uninstall

### Publish

### Exit

```bash
# does nothing
klepto exit
```

Under the hood Klepto uses [Vorpal](http://vorpal.js.org/) which adds an `exit` command to the command list. Vorpal supports an interactive CLI session where an application will accept all commands from it's own prompt. Therefore it is important to offer an `exit` command to leave that session.

Klepto disables this feature, but the `exit` command is added by Vorpal.
